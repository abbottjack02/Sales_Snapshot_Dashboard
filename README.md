# Sales_Snapshot_Dashboard
CoffeeShopMVP is a lightweight, client-only React + TypeScript app that turns Square “Sales Summary” CSV exports into clear diagnostic signals for coffee shop owners. It aggregates data by day, normalizes by operating vs calendar days, and highlights what actually changed—volume, ticket size, discounts, or behavior.
